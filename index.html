      <p class="main-text"><b>Love, you’re definitely the best thing that’s happened to me this year and maybe ever.</b></p>

      <p><b>We joke about being perfect, but I’m starting to think… we might actually be onto something. Lyk if there was a queen of everything, it’d be you. And your laugh? Instant serotonin, the kind that could make any bad day feel like wao bigla akong sumakses ganon, eme! Hahahahhahahhah and your voice bebe? That’s straight up oxytocin, making me feel things I shouldn’t be feeling (tinigasan) 😣</b></p>

      <p><b>You're like the perfect combination of sunshine and coffee coz you light up my day, and you keep me going! I’m so lucky to have you, I don’t do promises but I can guarantee I’ll try my best to never mess this up.</b></p>

      <p><b>So I’ve been thinking. I don’t want to just call this "something" I want to call it US. I want to look at you and know you’re mine, and you know you’ve got me fully, officially, no in-between.</b></p>
