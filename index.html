  <h1><b>Dearest, Marie</b></h1>
  
  <p><b>Love, youâ€™re definitely the best thing thatâ€™s happened to me this year and maybe ever.</b></p>
  
  <p><b>We joke about being perfect, but Iâ€™m starting to thinkâ€¦ we might actually be onto something. Like if there was a queen of everything, itâ€™d be you. And your laugh? Instant serotonin, the kind that could make any bad day feel like *wao bigla akong sumakses* ganon, eme! Hahaha! And your voice, bebe? Thatâ€™s straight up oxytocin, making me feel things I shouldnâ€™t be feeling (*tinigasan* ðŸ˜£).</b></p>
  
  <p><b>Youâ€™re like the perfect combination of sunshine and coffee coz you light up my day, and you keep me going! Iâ€™m so lucky to have you. I donâ€™t do promises but I can guarantee Iâ€™ll try my best to never mess this up.</b></p>
  
  <p><b>So Iâ€™ve been thinking... I donâ€™t want to just call this "something" â€” I want to call it US. I want to look at you and know youâ€™re mine, and you know youâ€™ve got me fully, officially, no in-between.</b></p>
