  <h1><b>Dearest, Marie</b></h1>

  <p><b>Love, you’re definitely the best thing that’s happened to me this year and maybe ever.</b></p>
  <p><b>We joke about being perfect, but I’m starting to think… we might actually be onto something. Like if there was a queen of everything, it’d be you. And your laugh? Instant serotonin. Your voice? Straight up oxytocin (tinigasan haha).</b></p>
  <p><b>You’re like the perfect combo of sunshine and coffee — you light up my day and keep me going. I’m lucky to have you. I won’t promise perfection, but I promise I’ll always try my best.</b></p>
  <p><b>So I’ve been thinking... I don’t want to call this just "something." I want to call it US.</b></p>
